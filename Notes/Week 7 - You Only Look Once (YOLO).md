- Avoid region proposal step 
- We run whole image and then we find object thresholds
- Image is only passed once

Steps:
1. Split the image into a grid 
2. Each cell predicts boxes and confidence P(object)
3. Force grid cell to make 2 bounding box predictions, we given them predictions and confidence 
4. Each cell also predicts a class probability - coarse segmentation of the image, probability of P(x|object)
5. Combine the box and class predictions 
6. Preform NMS (non maximum suppression)and threshold detections

How to train?

- For a fixed image it will always produce a fixed tensor size
- Easily trained in end to end fashion![[Screenshot 2023-02-20 at 15.30.43.png]]

During training:
1. Match an example to the right cell, with a ground truth bounding box
2. Adjust the cells prediction class
3. The cell will make 2 prediction, adjust it, increase the confidence
4. Decrease the confidence of other boxes, to 0
5. Do for all the cells - Some cells donâ€™t have any ground truth detections
	1. Decrease the confidence of these boxes both
	2. We don't adjust the class probabilities on the cells with no truth of the cell
