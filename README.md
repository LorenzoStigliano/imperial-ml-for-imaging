# Machine Learning for Imaging

This module covers the fundamental concepts and advanced methodologies of machine learning for imaging and relates those to real-world problems in computer vision and medical image analysis. You will experience different approaches to machine learning including supervised and unsupervised techniques with an emphasis on deep learning methods. Applications include image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and localisation, and registration. A key objective is to equip you with the skills needed to work in, and conduct research into, image computing and applied machine learning.
